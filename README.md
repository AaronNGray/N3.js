# Node-n3 is aÂ Notation3 and RDF library for node.js.

[**Notation3 or N3**](http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) is a superset of [RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/), the [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) language.  
This library will provide a high-performance N3 store, parser, and generator (when finished).

[**Bringing reasoning to the Web**](http://reasoning.restdesc.org/) is the initiative with several open source projects (such as this one) that make N3 reasoning accessible.

# Use the node-n3 library.

## Installation
You can install the n3 library as an [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package.

``` bash
$ npm install n3
```

## Storing and finding items

In this example below, we create a new store and add the triples `:Pluto a :Dog.` and `:Mickey a :Mouse`.  
Then, we find a triple with `:Mickey` as subject.

``` js
var n3 = require('n3');
var store = new n3.Store();

store.add(':Pluto', 'a', ':Dog');
store.add(':Mickey', 'a', ':Mouse');

var mickey = store.find(':Mickey', null, null)[0];
console.log(mickey.subject, mickey.predicate, mickey.object, '.');
// :Mickey a :Mouse .
```
